# The Fundamentals of Machine Learning

"The future of Artificial Intelligence, as envisioned by Amit Ray, is one characterized by compassion, non-violence, and love rather than conflict. As we embark on this journey, the fundamental requirement for machine learning is a solid foundation in coding, particularly in languages like Python or R. Even if you lack advanced coding skills, there's a solution at hand. Begin by mastering the following core Python concepts:

- Variables
- Datatypes
- Datatype Conversion
- String handling (including slicing, indexing, concatenation, repetition, and string methods)
- Lists (indexing, slicing, built-in functions, and operations)
- Tuples (indexing, slicing, built-in functions, and operations)
- Dictionaries and Sets
- Conditionals and loops (IF, ELSE, IFELSE, FOR, WHILE)
- Functions
- Classes, Objects, and Inheritance
